# ScotSKI
Student unit website First Year: http://webdev.edinburghcollege.ac.uk/~HNDMALAMINOS/ScotSKI/

ScotSKI is the first website that we had to do individually for the HND Web Development Year 1 (First semester).

First, I made a ScotSKI website with Bootstrap, but I really wanted to do something different and learn new skills, I wanted to push myself a little bit harder.

Therefore, I decided to build this one with pure CSS, no frameworks whatsoever, but with the help of the amazing Flexbox.

This was then, my first shot at flexbox, which I now need to work to improve upon. Very happy with the result nevertheless.
